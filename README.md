# Smart_fleet_routing
Overview

I developed an optimization solution to determine the most efficient set of routes for a fleet of vehicles serving a given set of customers. By leveraging advanced algorithms and optimization techniques, the system minimizes total travel costs and distances while ensuring timely and effective service delivery.

By optimizing the route planning for a fleet of vehicles serving a designated set of customers, we can reduce overall travel costs and minimize the total distance covered. This solution is particularly beneficial for industries such as logistics, distribution, and public services, where efficient transportation plays a crucial role in daily operations.

Features

Route Optimization: Determines the most efficient paths for vehicles to follow.

Cost Reduction: Minimizes operational expenses by optimizing routes.

Data-Driven Approach: Uses real-world data to enhance route planning.

Scalability: Can be adapted for various fleet sizes and industries.
